Homework Assignment: Animated Navigation Menu

    Task 1: Animated Navigation Menu
        Requirements:
            3-5 menu links with smooth transitions
            CSS transforms (not left/top positioning)
            Hamburger menu that transforms to X
            Staggered menu item animations

    Task 2: Hover Effects for Buttons
        Requirements:
            3 Button Styles with distinct effects:
            Button 1: Scale & Shadow Lift (grows on hover with shadow)
            Button 2: Gradient Animation (background gradient slides)
            Button 3: Border Glow Animation (border color + shadow glow)
            Complete CSS Examples:
            Scale and transform effects with cubic-bezier timing
            Gradient animation with background-position
            Glow effects with multiple box-shadows
            Active and disabled states
            Focus states for accessibility


Homework Assignment: Interactive Forms & Parallax Scrolling

    Task 1: Interactive Form Design
        Requirements:
            Build a form with at least four input fields (e.g., text, email, password, select).
            Each field must change its appearance based on its state:
            On focus: border color, shadow, or background changes.
            On blur: validation feedback appears—success (valid) or error (invalid).
            On valid input: show a green border/indicator and a “success” message.
            On invalid input: show a red border/indicator and a descriptive error message.
            Use smooth CSS transitions for all visual changes.
            Use only CSS selectors (:focus, :valid, :invalid) and transition/animation properties. Minimal JS, only for custom validation if required.
            All state changes must be visually clear and accessible.


    Task 2: Parallax Scrolling Effect
        Requirements:
            Create a web page layout with at least two content sections and one visually distinct background.
            Implement a CSS-based parallax effect so the background image moves slower than foreground content during scroll.
            Do not use external JS libraries—focus on pure CSS approaches such as background-attachment: fixed, transform, or scroll-driven CSS animations.
            Parallax effect should be smooth and noticeable, but not distracting. Page must work well on both desktop and mobile.
            Provide fallback for reduced motion settings (@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)).
